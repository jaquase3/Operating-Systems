#Operating System Functions
### The operating system serves some of the main purposes of a PC including managing devices, allowing the user to interact with the PC, and helping execute programs. The OS makes sure the PC is running properly and manages input and output. Operating systems can control multiple programs at once and are necessary when booting software.  

### The Operating System also helps control secuity for the users that are interacting with the PC. When someone logs into a guest profile the processor prevents them from making administrator changes that are unauthorized. The OS will also help display any erros with this operation. 

### As noted previously the OS helps manage the input, output, and some memory functions. 
-Input would be devices similar to keyboards, and mice
-Outputs would be similar to monitors and audio devices
-Memory could be anywhere from sending data to RAM/DDrives
